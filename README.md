  The Potato Clock
</h1>






Welcome to **The Potato Clock**, your cozy kitchen companion for cooking sweet potatoes *just right*. Whether you’re roasting wedges, mashing them up, or baking them whole, this adorable timer will keep track while you relax. ⏲️

I made this app out of my love for sweet potatoes. They’re cozy, versatile, and full of flavor. I cook them very often, but I always forget how long each of my favorite methods takes.
That little hiccup inspired me to build a warm and playful timer just for sweet potatoes.💛
